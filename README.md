## Usage
BodyFat.csv is the raw dataset which contains 252 men with measurement of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.

cleaned_data.csv is the dataset after deleting some dirty data on BodyFat.csv. This dataset is used to build model in this project.

Code.Rmd is a RMarkDown file which contains code of data cleaning, model, hypothesis checking and assumptions checking.

app.R is the R code which used to build a application called Body Fat Calculator based on our model. You can use it in this website.[Body Fat Calculator]（https://yuxiao2268.shinyapps.io/BodyFat/）

Summary.pdf is our brieef report of this project in which we described our motivation, model selection, statistical analysis, model diagnosis and model strengths and weaknesses.
