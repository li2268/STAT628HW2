## Usage
BodyFat.csv is the raw dataset which contains 252 men with measurement of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.

cleaned_data.csv is the dataset after deleting some dirty data on BodyFat.csv. This dataset is used to build model in this project.

Code.Rmd is a RMarkDown file which contains code of data cleaning, model, hypothesis checking and assumptions checking.

app.R is the R code which used to build a application called Body Fat Calculator based on our model. You can use it in this website.[Body Fat Calculator]（https://yuxiao2268.shinyapps.io/BodyFat/）

1-6.png are images of data processing and model diagnosis.

Summary.pdf is our brief report of this project in which we described our motivation, model selection, statistical analysis, model diagnosis and model strengths and weaknesses.
